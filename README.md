Malloc
======

A code for the system functions malloc, realloc, and calloc ( C ).

This project is a recode (using low-level UNIX functions) of the Malloc, and free functions.

This algorithm I use was about the pagination of the memory, and the research of free memory block to fit before reallocing some new memory.
